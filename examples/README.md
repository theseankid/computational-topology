The best order to view these noteboooks is:

1. `ellipsoids_on_S1.ipynb` this helps visualize how distances are calculated in a point cloud of data with overlapping circles (n-spheres) and ellipsoids
2. `diagrams.ipynb` compute the persistent homology diagrams with different algorithms for calculating distance
