Various scripts and notebooks related to computing and visualizing Persistent Homology.


Givent two datasets how can you tell if they are similar?

Linear regression gives nearly the same result but for two very different datasets, a normally distributed blob of points, and a torus, but they have very different structure.

## Filtration Examples
